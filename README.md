Steps To Run:
1) Change working directory in the "Directories" cell to match your current directory. PS: testing driectory is already set to ""/content/drive/MyDrive/COEN240/Testing""
2) Run All the required cells
3) To try on test data, you can directly run the "Tesing Data preparation" and "Model test" Cells. The testing data should be named as "1_0.jpeg" and labels.txt should have entries like "1 Name". This is the same as dataset 2 that was released.
Data augmentaton and pre-processing does not have to be run since pre-processed data is already dumped to a pickle file.
4) You can see random pre-processed smaples by running "See pre-processed training image" cell
5) The "Remove Augmented Data" cell deleetd all the augmented data from the dataset folder in case you need to run augmentation again.
